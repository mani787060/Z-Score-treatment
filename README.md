# Project: Z-Score Treatment

-> This project demonstrates how to detect and handle outliers in data using the Z-Score method.
-> A Z-Score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean — points beyond a certain threshold (commonly ±3) are considered outliers.
-> The project includes visualizations and practical handling strategies for both numerical and continuous features.
 
## Highlights:-
 
-> Calculate Z-Scores to detect outliers
-> Apply threshold-based filtering (±3)
-> Visualize data before and after outlier treatment
-> Compare distribution changes
-> Implemented using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib

## Libraries Used:- 
 
-> pandas
-> numpy
-> matplotlib
-> seaborn

## Goal:-
 
-> To learn how to identify, visualize, and handle outliers effectively using the Z-Score technique, ensuring cleaner and more reliable data for modeling.
